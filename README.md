## How to install?

## The mod is warning me that I have no hotkeys set, why?
The mod does not set your hotkeys automatically, you have to set them manually in the game settings.
## I can only select 200 units at once, why?
This limit is hard coded into the game, I could probably bypass it but that feels like cheating to me.
## The "count" hotkey doesn't work when units are in a formation. how to change that?
To disable formations being selected as a whole go to: Options→Game Session→Battalion-style formations.
